# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- New high-level Scheimpflug intrinsics workflow:
  - Rust API: `vision_calibration::scheimpflug_intrinsics::run_calibration`
  - Python API: `vision_calibration.run_scheimpflug_intrinsics`
  - Typed Python models and stubs for Scheimpflug config/result payloads
- Synthetic integration tests for Scheimpflug calibration in `vision-calibration`
- Python runtime test coverage for Scheimpflug bindings

### Changed
- Enforced workspace layering by moving Scheimpflug solver implementation to `vision-calibration-pipeline` and keeping `vision-calibration` as facade re-export
- Expanded documentation with Scheimpflug usage snippets for Rust and Python
- CI hardening:
  - `cargo clippy` now runs with `--all-features`
  - `cargo test` now runs with `--all-features`
  - Added Python extension build + runtime test job in CI
- PyPI release workflow now validates Python runtime tests before publishing

### Breaking
- Minor release boundary update to `0.2.0` to reflect compatibility boundary changes across recent API work

## [0.1.2]

### Added
- **Iterative intrinsics estimation** in `vision-calibration-linear`: New `IterativeIntrinsicsSolver` for jointly estimating camera intrinsics (K) and Brown-Conrady distortion without requiring ground truth distortion preprocessing
- **Distortion fitting** in `vision-calibration-linear`: New `DistortionSolver` for closed-form estimation of radial (k1, k2, k3) and tangential (p1, p2) distortion coefficients from homography residuals
- **Shared test utilities** in `vision-calibration-core`: New `test_utils` module providing common calibration test data structures (`CalibrationView`, `ViewDetections`, `CornerInfo`) and helper functions
- **Realistic calibration tests**: New integration tests demonstrating full calibration pipeline without ground truth distortion (in `stereo_linear.rs` and `planar_intrinsics_real_data.rs`)
- Comprehensive documentation for all new modules with usage examples and algorithm descriptions
- Linear solver additions in `vision-calibration-linear`: camera matrix DLT + RQ decomposition, linear triangulation, 7-point fundamental, 5-point essential + decomposition, P3P, and EPnP
- New `vision-calibration-linear` README with algorithm overview and usage notes

### Changed
- Updated `vision-calibration-linear` lib.rs to export new `distortion_fit` and `iterative_intrinsics` modules
- Refactored test files to use shared utilities from `vision-calibration-core::test_utils`, eliminating code duplication
- Updated CLAUDE.md with detailed documentation of iterative intrinsics feature and typical workflow
- Expanded rustdoc across `vision-calibration-linear` algorithms and updated top-level README to reflect new solver coverage
