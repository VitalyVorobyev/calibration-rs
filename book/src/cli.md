# CLI

Using `calib-cli` for reproducible experiments and pipelines.

- Installation and build targets; `cargo run -p calib-cli -- --help`.
- Input/output file formats (serde JSON), expected fields, and common pitfalls.
- Configuring robust kernels and iteration limits via JSON.
- Batch processing tips and integrating with shell scripts or CI.
- Future work: subcommands for rig extrinsics, hand–eye, and dataset inspection.

> TODO: include example input files and sample output report.
