# Introduction

`calibration-rs` is a Rust toolbox for calibrating vision sensors and multi-camera rigs. The goal is to provide correct, modern algorithms with a clean separation between math primitives, linear initialisation, non-linear refinement, and ready-to-use pipelines.

This book will grow alongside the project. It will document the math, the APIs, and end-to-end workflows. Each chapter contains a short checklist of what will be covered.

- What you'll learn:
  - Motivation and problem statements for camera calibration.
  - How the crates map to typical calibration pipelines.
  - Where to find examples and CLI tools.
